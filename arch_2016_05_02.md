See accompanying diagram 

## Overview
* Alpha 2 contains:
  + User interface
    - Tools
    - Outliner
  + Command controllers/dispatchers
    - Tool dispatcher
    - Outline dispatcher

* Icarus NT algorithms

* Icarus objects
  + GenGraph, Surface, Volume, Func3D

* Underlying libraries
  + cgal, libigl, ...

## Overview in more detail
* User interface: tools
  + the user interacts with tools, e.g., the Thickener Tool
  + displays and collects user input for specific parameters
  + enforces constraints on types, ranges, etc
  
* User Interface: Outliner
  + UI for scene objects
  + displays all scene objects (and eventually their heirarchy / relationships)
  + manages object visibility
  + provides a user interface for the user to display info about scene objects

* Outliner Controller
  + manages all scene objects
  + manages creation and destruction of scene objects
  + provides access to mthods for information about scene objects
  + provides name service for scene objects

* Controllers/dispatchers
  + C/d is temporary (may reconsdier this ...)
  + C/d communicates with the UI
    - receives parameters and action request from UI
    - updates UI with results
    - coordinates rendering algorithms and passage of render object to the UI
    - c/d sends render objects and results to tools for display
  + C/d manages running of algorithms
    - issues commands to NT algorithms
    - controls data passage between algorithms and the Outliner Controller

* NT Algorithms
  + Use the underlying Icarus entities for all representation

* Icarus entities
  + Each of the four major entities have a robust set of operators specific to that entity
  + Different reprsentations may be used internally
  + Interface is not dependent on the internal representation
  + Caller may request type of internal representation
  + Caller may not access internal structure

* Render Objects
  + geometry that can be displayed in a GL window

* Render Algorithms
  + query Icarus objects
  + procude render objects
